# customer-chatbot- Project 
This Python code is for building and training a neural network chatbot model that classifies user inputs into predefined intents. Here's a breakdown of the code:

# 1. Importing Libraries
The code uses libraries such as:

random: For shuffling data.
json: To load intent patterns and responses from a JSON file.
pickle: For saving preprocessed data for later use.
numpy: To handle numerical arrays.
nltk: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and lemmatization.
tensorflow: To build and train the neural network model.
# 2. Data Preprocessing
Loading the intents JSON: The intents.json file contains patterns (user inputs) and corresponding tags (intents).
Tokenization: Each pattern is split into words using nltk.word_tokenize.
Lemmatization: Words are converted to their base form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").
Ignoring special characters: Characters like ?, !, ., , are excluded from processing.
Creating word lists:
words: Stores unique lemmatized words from patterns.
classes: Stores unique intent tags.
# 3. Creating Training Data
Each pattern in intents.json is represented as a "bag of words" vector:
1 if the word is in the pattern, 0 otherwise.
Corresponding output labels (one-hot encoded) are created based on the intent tag.
# 4. Model Definition
A sequential neural network is created using TensorFlow:
Input layer: Accepts vectors of the size len(words) (unique word count).
Hidden layers: Two dense layers with 128 and 64 neurons, respectively, and relu activation.
Dropout layers: Reduce overfitting by randomly setting 50% of weights to zero.
Output layer: Predicts intent with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
# 5. Model Compilation and Training
Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 and momentum.
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy, suited for multi-class classification.
Training:
The model is trained for 400 epochs with a batch size of 5.
# 6. Saving the Model
The trained model is saved as chatbot_model.h5.
Processed word lists and classes are stored using pickle for reuse without reprocessing.
